### Geometry ###

This project follows closely Schwabenhaeuser.

See [set.mm#2983](https://github.com/metamath/set.mm/issues/2983):
> We *do* have all 3 *segment* versions of CPCTC, namely `cgr3simp1`, `cgr3simp2`, and `cgr3simp3`; we're just missing two of the CPCTC angle forms.
>
> SAS is already proven in `tgsas1` and `tgsas`. ASA is proven in `tgasa1` and `tgasa`. We don't actually have a proof of AAS (Angle-Angle-Side), Theorem 11.50 of [Schwabhauser] p. 108, we just have a placeholder.
