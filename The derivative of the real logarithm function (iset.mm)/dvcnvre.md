### The derivative rule for inverse functions

Many details of the proof will need intuitionizing.

The statement of the theorem probably will also need some
change (for example, I suppose the elements of `ran ( RR _D F )`
need to be apart from zero rather than merely not equal).

Perhaps the easiest way to approach this is going to be
to intuitionize set.mm
working forward starting from `dvmptsub` (which is the end
of where the derivatives have apparently been intuitionized),
seeing what can be intuitionized and what changes are needed.
Either `dvcnvre` will fall out of this process or it will be
more clear what its dependencies will be.
