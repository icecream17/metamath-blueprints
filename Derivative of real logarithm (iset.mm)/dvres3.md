### Restriction of a complex differentiable function to the reals

It isn't clear whether the theorem as stated in set.mm can be proved
and if so whether the proof will be similar to the set.mm one.
Current guess: yes and no respectively.  The reason for being skeptical
this will be proved the same way is the use of things
like set difference in the statement of [restntr](https://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/restntr.html)
and excluded middle, e.g. df-or, in its proof.
